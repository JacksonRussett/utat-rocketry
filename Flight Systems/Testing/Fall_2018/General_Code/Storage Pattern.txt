Each message of each data type will start with a character specific to that message followed by the actual
message itself. All messages must contain a timestamp of the form long in milliseconds. This will be 4 bytes in size as longs have 4 bytes of size.
For messages with components (ex. x y z): they will simply be adjacent.
No spacing or terminators needed for messages as the message size length will be constant for each data type

Float data will be in 4 bytes sent over.

Ex. message for acceleration

A[accel x][accel y][accel z][time stamp]

MS5611 Pressure Sensor Data:
P - pressure
T - temperature

IMU Data:
A - acceleration (has 3 axis)
M - magnetic field (has 3 axis)
G - gyro (has 3 axis)

GPS Data:
L - location data (latitude - positive means north, longitude - positive means west)
U - universal time (hours minutes seconds)
H - altitude
(will not be used due to problems with showing speed and track made good) S - ground velocity (track made good - relative to true north, speed)

Potential Changes:
L U H data gets put together into one string with only one time rather than
put times seperately for their own strings as these data gets received all
at the same time.

A M G data gets put together into one string to be sent at once rather than seperately
as data for each of these often come at the same time so bytes stored for time can be reduced.
